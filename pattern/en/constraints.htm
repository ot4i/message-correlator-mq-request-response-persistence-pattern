<h1 class="topictitle1">Constraints on the use of the 
<span>Message Correlator for WebSphere MQ: request-response with persistence</span> pattern</h1>
<div>
<p class="shortdesc">A number of constraints apply when you use this pattern.</p>
<p>You can use the <span>Message Correlator for WebSphere MQ: request-response with persistence</span> pattern
only if you meet all of the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your requester and provider applications must use <span>WebSphere MQ</span> as the transport mechanism.</li>
<li>Your provider applications must follow the convention of copying the message identifier to 
the correlation identifier so that the broker can match the responses to their original request.</li>
<li>Your requester and provider applications must send and accept compatible messages, unless 
you include transformation capability in the customizable RequestProcessor subflow.</li>
<li>If you choose to enable logging in the pattern, the log messages are sent to a queue.
The processing of these log messages is outside the scope of this pattern and you must process the 
logging messages in the way most appropriate for your organization. When logging is selected, log messages 
are written to the log queue as persistent messages, which affects performance. Persistent messages are 
used because it is assumed that logging is being used for audit purposes. If logging is for test or 
information only, logging can be switched off in production systems by configuring the user-defined 
properties (UDPs): 
<span class="msobjprop">RequestLoggingOn</span> and <span class="msobjprop">ResponseLoggingOn</span>.</li>
<li>If you choose to enable error messages in the pattern, error messages are sent to a queue 
when an exception occurs. Monitoring errors and taking corrective action is outside the scope of the pattern, 
and you must process the error messages in the way most appropriate for your organization.</li>
<li>The pattern defines its own format for logging and error messages and it is assumed 
that these are sufficient to meet the requirements in your own environment.</li>
</ul>
